## CONTROLLING A REMOTE CONTROL CAR WITH THE HACKRF

On YouTube user 王康 has been working with his HackRF One to create a computer keyboard controlled interface for his remote control car. The HackRF is a ~$300 software defined radio similar to the RTL-SDR, but with transmit capabilities.

To control the car he wrote a [GNU Radio program](https://github.com/scateu/gr-remotecar) to generate a control signal that is transmitted by the HackRF and a GUI to listen to keyboard presses on the PC.
