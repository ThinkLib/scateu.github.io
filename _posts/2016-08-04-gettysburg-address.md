# The Gettysburg Address 

Four [score]{二十} and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, [conceived]{孕育于} in Liberty, and [dedicated to]{奉行} the [proposition]{主张} that all men are created equal.

Now we are [engaged]{从事} in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can [long endure]{长久存在}. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to [dedicate]{奉献} a [portion]{部分} of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is [altogether fitting]{完全应该} and [proper]{非常恰当} that we should do this.

But, [in a larger sense]{从更广泛的意义上来说}, we can not dedicate -- we can not [consecrate]{圣化} -- we can not [hallow]{神化} -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or [detract]{减}. The world will [little note]{不大会注意}, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for [us the living]{我们这些还活着的人}, [rather]{毋宁说}, [to be]{应该} [dedicated]{致力于} here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is [rather]{倒是} for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased [devotion]{献身精神} to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have [died in vain]{白白牺牲} -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not [perish]{灭亡} from the earth.

Abraham Lincoln November 19, 1863
